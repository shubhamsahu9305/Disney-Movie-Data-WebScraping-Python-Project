# Disney-Movie-Data-WebScraping-Python-Project
In this project, I scrapped Wikipedia pages for Disney movie data creation.

scrapped_url = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Walt_Disney_Pictures_films"

This Project includes:
1) Web scraping with BeautifulSoup
2) Cleaning data
3) Pattern matching with regular expressions (Re library)
4) Working with dates (datetime library)
5) Saving & loading data with JSON and pandas library
6) Accessing data from an API using the Requests library

The Dataset created in this project contains Disney movie information such as movie title, producer, release year, budget, actor, etc.
